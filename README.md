# 2D_KPZ_polaritons

These codes were used for the majority of my work as a PhD student in the physics of exciton polaritons. They consist of:
1)  One utils.pu module with various helper functions;
2)  One model.py module with the Gross-Pitaevskii equation solver class;
3)  A few modules to extract different observables via parallel calculation.

feel free to drop me an email at konstantinos.delis5@gmail.com for any questions regarding their usage :)
